= Introduction =

This window contains the list of the available object types that you can put into your stage.

=Description=

If you select an object form the list the action will automatically change to _add object stage_ in the [EditorMainS#Action_Table action table], so you can click on action to place some object on the stage that you selected.

==Scale==
Object scale. You can scale the object with this parameter. Use this parameter carefully, because only the visible object will be scaled by this factor, but not this physical.

==Rotate==
Object rotation around the _Y_ coordinate in degrees.

==Object Texture Preview==
If you select an object you can see its texture(s) in the preview.

==Object Type List==
The available objects that you can use in a stage. And you can see some prameters of the object:
 * name
 * [Terminilogy#Object category]
 * [Terminilogy#Object num (dense information)]
 * the number of the objects of a type that are currently in use (visible)
 * how many object found in the object cache (maybe visible, maybe not)
