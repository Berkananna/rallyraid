|| *activate race* || activate the selected [Terminology#Race race] and [Terminology#Stage stage], which means deactivate the old ones, remove _objects_/_roads_ everything that belongs to the old [Terminology#Stage stage] and add _objects_/_roads_/_itinerary points_ to the scene from the new stage. ||
|| *reset* || put you and your car to the [Terminology#Earth_Tile tile] that you wrote into the _tile inputs_ on the _S_ tab on on the main window ||
|| *reload* || reload , but you will be left at the position where you were. ||

==Tab content==

===Render Helpers===
If it is checked, then it is use special draw elements to indicate the stage elements (object, road points, itinerary points, way points).

===Render All Roads===
If it is checked render helpers of all road points of all [Terminology#Road roads] will be rendered. Otherwise only the currently selected will be rendered.

===Tables===

There are two tables on the selection tab:
 * selection table
 * action table

====Selection Table====
Selection table contains the currently selected:
 * object type
 * [Terminology#Race race]
 * [Terminology#Day day]
 * [Terminology#Stage stage]
 * [Terminology#road road]
 * [EditorMainRoM road type]
 * [EditorMainIti itinerary images]
 * [EditorStageWP way point type]
 * stage length

Many of the list element like race, day, stage is a shortcut to reach the race-, day-, stage window. So you don't need to go the [EditorStageGO stage window] through the [EditorMainRaM race manager tab] -> race -> day -> stage.

====Action Table====
Action table contains the actions, that you can do during the stage editing: add/remove stuffs.
