==Road Stage Table==
N/A

==Visual Road Table==

Displaying all part of a long road make a big performance hit. So i only display the parts of the roads, which are next to the player. How? As i chopped the [Terminology#Earth Earth] into [Terminology#Earth_Tile tiles], i also chopping the roads at stage loading along these [Terminology#Earth_Tile tiles]. I call the part of the road which is on a tile _road chunk_. This table contains information about the _road chunks_:
 * road name
 * the number of the start point of the chunk
 * the number of the end point of the chunk

==Road Types Table==
The list of the available road types. If you select a road type from the list, then its texture will be displayed in the image above this table.

There is a special type _null`_`road_, which is used in case where you don't need the visible stuf only the property of the roads:
 * makes object density zero, so there won't be placed objects along the road
 * makes ground texture a bit different

More information can be found on the [EditorStageRoads road tab page].
