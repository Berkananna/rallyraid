#summary This page describe how to install the game

= Introduction =

As Rally Raid Game can handle several races there is two part of the install:
  # install the game
  # install race

You can use the game alone, or with many of the races.

= Install the game =

The game has also two downloadable part:
  # runtime
  # base

*The game only works if both part is installed!* But after it it is possible than an update for the game contains only the runtime part. In this case you only need to download the runtime and install.

== Game runtime ==

The runtime contains the executables, libraries and configuration files. The runtime often changes.

== Game base ==

The base contains any other part, that need the game to work, and to create races from scratch:
  * backgrounds
  * earth texture
  * fonts
  * hud textures
  * roadbook textures
  * shader programs
  * menu textures
  * object meshes and textures
  * road types with textures
  * skies
  * smoke textures
  * sounds
  * vehicle datas and textures

The base part of the game changes rarely, that's why they are separated from the runtime.
